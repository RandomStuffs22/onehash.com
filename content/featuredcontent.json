        Exclusive Enlightenment Bundle.  Winner of the audience award at SXSW, KumarÃ© follows the story of ï¬lmmaker Vikram Gandhi as he sets out to expose blind faith and yoga fakes in America. Gandhi grows a beard, puts on an oversized Indian accent, and travels to Arizona as KumarÃ©: (false) prophet. But soon, his pretend mantras gain a real following. Gandhi lets us watch what happen when faith gets put to the test. To celebrate the launch of KumarÃ©, weâ€™re releasing an exclusive BitTorrent Enlightenment bundle. Letâ€™s get spiritual, yâ€™all. Download the bundle, ï¬nd showtimes, and spread the teachings of KumarÃ©.

		Death Grips premier \"I've Seen Footage\" on BitTorrent. Sacramento noise/rap band Death Grips have become well known for their
dark, loud, glitched-out sound that continues the trend of taking rap into
stranger territory. Since their first mixtape, Exmilitary, blew up in 2011,
the band (which consists of vocalist Stefan Burnett and production
team Zach Hill and Andy Morin) have continued to push and shove the envelope
with their aggressive, angular, un-definable brand of music. In keeping
with keeping it weird, their latest release â€œI've Seen Footageâ€ switches
things up once again.
